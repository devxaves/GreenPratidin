# A social community Platform to address the Waste management, carbon footprint and environmental issues

## THE PROBLEMS IT SOLVE

1. Wastage Management a huge problem for the present and upcoming generations, but we are providing a more sustainable solution. The awareness comes from community and we are providing a platform to bring the community together and share pics and information regarding waste dumps in their surroundings so that the authorities and the respective stakeholders to take necessary cleaning steps. The community can chat and share green messages together
2. Air Pollution and Breaathing problems are on a rise in India and we provide AQI checker. People can get aware of the Air Quality Index around them beforehand and take necessary steps.
3. Carbon FootPrint is a major problem of the entire world. Where at present an average human creates 4 tonnes of carbon footprint per year, UN suggests to reduce it to <2 Tonnes/year. We provide a carbon footprint tracker for every person so that they can check themselves and save us from Global Warming and other hazards.

## TECH STACKS WE USED

## MongoDB
Using Semantic Search and store the application's database , MongoDB Atlas was the best choice out there. We stored our users data and Posts data in Clusters of MongoDB Atlas Cloud. Moreover we used MongoDB's data API as the backend API and easily make HTTP requests to the API and retrieve our data and use it appropriately.

## Auth0
Auth0 stands out as one of the best authentication platform to be used for social community applications where a huge number of traffic and user data needs to be monitored. We have well used it in our project and implemented Auth0's authentication services for logging securely into our Social Platform. Moreover it enabled us to customise the LogIn and SignUp pages in a easy way and embed our brand identities into it. We further connected it with MongoDB to store user credentials.

## Python
To Create the carbon Footprint tracker we used Python. We used Streamlit to deploy our project so that we get a user friendly and proper UI
